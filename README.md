### Compilation/uploading

> You'll need the Arduino IDE installed already. You can get this [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

Because we're using two robots, this project doesn't use the typical process of uploading sketches for Arduino.

See [/src/arduino](/src/arduino) for instructions.
